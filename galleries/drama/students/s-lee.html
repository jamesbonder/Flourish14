 <h3>About Sophie's Work</h3><p>I am an undergraduate who for the past three years has been studying a BA (Hons) degree in Performance and Media. As part of my course I have been given the opportunity to develop and increase my knowledge of different areas within the media industry. </p><p>I would like to pursue a career in television Presenting, however, I am also interested in acting for film and television as well as film and television production.</p><p>Through University I was given the opportunity to present on Exposure Tv, the universities own television programme which aired live for a week in April. Whilst presenting on the show I took on different roles, these ranged from main presenting to presenting a feature called the Hub, I also worked as an on the day reporter. I also created my own television package for the show which was based around the challenges graduates face after leaving university.</p><p>I undertook a one week work placement at an Independent film and training company based in South Wales called It's My Shout. Whilst there I was able to experience how the company works and took on different responsibilities throughout the week.<p>I am a confident person with good communication skills. I am able to work individually and as part of a team. I am hard working and dedicated to whatever it is that I am working. I take responsibility for my own work and make sure that it is completed on time and to a high standard.</p></p><p><strong><a href="http://sophielouiselee.wordpress.com/" title="Sophie's Website">View more of Sophie's work at her website.</a></strong></p>

 <h3>About Scott's Work</h3><p>I studied Ba (HONS) Fashion Promotion at University of South Wales, Cardiff. During this time it allowed me to gain a lot of knowledge into the fashion industry combined with different internships. Fashion visualisation, Fashion promotion methods and principle, Visual merchandising, Colour trend forecasting, Styling, Fashion brand promotion, Fashion photography, Fashion media, Buying, Promotional campaign development and Fashion entrepreneurship. I have also worked with stylists from vogue, worked with urban outfitters visual merchandising and worked with Jayne hicks (freelance stylist). I have also interned with TOAST for several months. 
<br>
<br>
My final major project allowed me to rebrand an existing company ‘Silk’ a local dress shop which sells a wide range of dresses and accessories. Silk is located in a small village and is known within the local community, it's a relatively new brand and is successful. Rebranding Silk will allow me to use my knowledge to promote and develop new material that will reach a wider audience. By rebranding an existing brand it will be crucial to fully understand the brand as well as know its current market, brand positioning, USP, competitors and other factors to the brand.
<br>
<br>
The aim is to create promotional material that has a sleek design with coherent theme throughout. In order to do this an evaluation will be completed in order to implement a plan to promote Silk, by creating a series of images that can be used on a number of different 
platform’s, professional logo, various social media, look book and business stationary.</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.scottmichaeljones.com/" title="Scott's Website">View more of Scott's work at his website.</a></strong></p>

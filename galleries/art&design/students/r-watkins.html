    <h3>About Rachael's Work</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm Rachael and I'm a graphic design student from Milton Keynes. I am interested in typography and print design.
</p><p>For my FMP, I decided to focus on typography, as it is a key element of graphic design. It is essential to communication. I think its really important for design students to not only learn about, but be excited by type. I then designed a pack, that can be used as an introduction to typography, presented in a visual way to appeal to these students. A part of that work is featured here.</p><p>During my course I have gained experience using Adobe software including Illustrator, InDesign and Photoshop. I have completed branding, web and print based projects including building a website and creating a multimedia anti-bullying campaign, which consisted of posters, web adverts, a flash piece and a flyer set. 
</p><p>Last summer, I completed a two week work experience placement at Essentials Magazine, part of the IPC Media Group. During this placement, I worked on Photoshop to retouch images and InDesign to layout pages and spreads for the September issue. I learnt a lot about layout design in a professional environment and it was very rewarding to see my work published in the magazine.
</p><p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading, visiting galleries and trying new things. I have recently taken up ballet lessons, which I am really enjoying. I also enjoy travelling and was fortunate enough to go on two university trips to New York and Tokyo.

 <h3>About India's Work</h3><p>I take much of my influences from the decade of the 1990's, whether that be the styling in the images or the photographic style. This became a starting point for my final University project.</p><p>Through my final project I am hoping to showcase my own work, along side the work of my peers, as a curated collective. I have chosen to display the work as a printed publication or magazine; something, which I feel reflects the way in which the photography industry is moving towards at the moment.</p><p>The element of nostalgia associated with magazines was the starting point for this concept. I have created a publication based around the decade of the 1990’s – combining my interests and the decade in which I was born, to put together a publication, which includes work from individuals who were born, or grew up during this time period. The magazine will include various genres of imagery, from documentary to fashion, and include commentary on the individuals featured and the successes they are having today. The publication will reflect the statement; ‘what we did then, and who we are now’.</p><p>The publication should reflect the photographic skills which I have learnt during my time at University, my understanding of theory in photography and others photographic work; whilst also showing my interest for publishing and editing printed content.</p><p>The images displayed here are taken by me and feature in the magazine.</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.indiamorrisphotography.com/" title="India's Website">View more of India's work at her website.</a></strong></p>
